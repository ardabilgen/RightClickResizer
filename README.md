# RightClickResizer

A simple tool that adds a "Resize Image" option to the Windows context menu.

## Installation

1. Run `build.bat` to create the `.exe` file (or run from source if Python is installed) or get it from Realeses.
2. Move the generated `dist/RightClickResizer.exe` to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\RightClickResizer`).
3. Run `RightClickResizer.exe` **as Administrator**.
4. Click the "Install Context Menu" button.

## Usage

1. Right-click on any image file (JPG, PNG, etc.).
2. Click "Resize Image".
3. A resized copy with `_resized` suffix will be created in the same directory.

## Settings

To change settings, run the program directly (without selecting an image). You can adjust max width, height, and quality.

## Uninstall

Open the program and click the "Uninstall" button.
